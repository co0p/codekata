A:

 Write a function that replaces all spaces in a given string
 by a %20 (except the trailing placeholders). 
 Assume a null-terminated string that is long
 enough to hold the final result (which length is given).

B:

 Given a string, compress it using the following scheme:
 e.g. abbccccddd -> a1b2c4d3; if the compressed string is
 not shorter than the original, than the original should be used
