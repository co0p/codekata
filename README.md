codekata
========

let's practise coding ... by coding :)

Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic
Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code
kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills 
through practice and repetition. As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 
21 different katas.

Kata
--------
Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"?) is a Japanese word describing detailed 
choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs. 
The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese martial 
arts in general.

Code 
--------
Source code (also referred to as source or code) is the version of software as 
it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in plain text 
(i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters).
