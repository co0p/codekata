sieve of eratosthenes

A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number 
divisors: 1 and itself.

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by 
Eratosthenes' method:
1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers 
   greater than p itself in the list. These numbers will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; 
   note that some of them may have already been marked.
4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If 
   there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number 
   (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.

When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked 
are prime.
