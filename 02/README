FizzBuzz

Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the
end of the lesson, your Maths teacher decides he should make his class more "fun" 
by introducing a "game". He explains that he is going to point at each pupil in 
turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from one. The "fun" 
part is that if the number is divisible by three, you instead say "fizz" and if 
it is divisible by five you say "buzz". So now your maths teacher is pointing at 
all of your classmates in turn, and they happily shout "one!", "two!", "fizz!", 
"four!", "buzz!"... until he very deliberately points at you, fixing you with a 
steely gaze... time stands still, your mouth dries up, your palms become sweatier
and sweatier until you finally manage to croak "fizz!". Doom is avoided, and the 
pointing finger moves on.

So of course in order to avoid embarrassment in front of your whole class, you have
to get the full list printed out so you know what to say. Your class has about 33
pupils and he might go round three times before the bell rings for break time. 
Next maths lesson is on Thursday. Get coding!

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three
print "fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "fizzbuzz".

Sample output:

1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
17
fizz
19
buzz
... etc up to 100
